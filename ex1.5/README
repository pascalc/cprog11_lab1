==ex1.5
Implementation of specialized vector<bool> using one bit to store the value of a boolean instead of a whole byte. Implementation is made by using a proxy that maps the index to a specific bit and either set it to zero or one depending on bool value.

==ex1.6
Making the const_iterator to work.

==ex1.7
Overloading the bitwise operators &, | and ^ on the vector<bool>. Also implement three different functions weight() that count the numbers of one in an array, that is the number of bits equal to true.
